Initial release.  

Includes functions to launch two shiny applications:

GST Power App can be used to run power and sample size calculations for the Global Statistical Test under a variety of scenarios.  Additional details can be found in the vignette.

Make Forestplot App allows users to easily generate a forestplot by uploading data, copy/pasting from a spreadsheet, or manually typing.  The resulting plot can be resized and visually customized in a variety of ways.  Also included are options to handle endpoints with inverted directionality and different scales.  See the vignette for additional details.
